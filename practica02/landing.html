          ‘The Boy Who Lies’, ran a Daily Prophet headline in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007).
          It was part of the character assassination the tabloid was conducting on Harry, although he did bend
          the truth on occasion. But who could blame him? He knew many things he just couldn’t tell other people;
          plus a good number of those people wanted him locked up or dead, so he was in a difficult position.<br><br>
          But when he wrongly told Ron and Hermione he was still practising Occlumency to block Voldemort from his
          mind… that was not such a situation. It’s hard to take – he lied to the faces of his two best friends,
          he kept it going when they suspected the untruth, and it was for self-serving reasons, albeit understandable
          ones.<br><br>
          (Ironically, the one time Harry got punished for lying, when Dolores Umbridge made him scar himself with
          the black quill, he was actually telling the truth. Sod’s law.)<br><br>
          <strong>Hermione Granger: ‘I went looking for the troll because I – I thought I could deal with it on my
          own – you know, because I’ve read all about them.’ </strong><br><br>
          Of all the lies that have ever been told, this may not be the most heinous. But it came from Hermione
          Granger, who seemed incapable of fibbing (witness her lame attempts at deception in Borgin and Burkes
          during Half-Blood Prince). It made Ron drop his wand in shock, and it’s a significant moment – by doing
          so she saved Ron and Harry from punishment, and the bond between the three was forged, along with an
          unspoken agreement that they’d look out for each other no matter what. So we forgive you, Hermione.
          <strong>Narcissa Malfoy: ‘He is dead!’ Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers</strong>.<br><br>
          And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his eyelids
          Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration.<br><br>

          Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows<br><br>
          This was a lie so enormous it makes us catch our breath on every read. Having spent the best
          part of seven books being thoroughly unlikeable, Narcissa Malfoy betrayed Voldemort at the
          Battle of Hogwarts and in doing so saved Harry when it seemed like it was curtains for him.
          Deceiving the Dark Lord put her own life in danger, but her redemption wasn’t complete – the waters
          were muddied by the fact she only did it to rescue her son Draco. Narcissa’s moral ambiguity is an
          example of what makes the books such interesting character studies: everyone has the potential to lie,
          whether it’s for good or bad ends.


          Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2<br><br>
          <trong>Severus Snape
          ‘Ah, Professor Snape,’ said Umbridge, smiling widely and standing up again. ‘Yes, I would like another bottle of Veritaserum, as quick as you can, please.’
          ‘You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter,’ he said, observing her coolly through his greasy curtains of black hair.</strong>

          Severus Snape was, perhaps, the most nuanced character in the whole series, from when he first glared at
          Harry during the welcome banquet to his death at the fangs of Nagini, and there were many occasions when
          we wondered where his loyalties really lay. One minute he was hostile, the next he was honourable; we loved
          him, then hated him, but never wanted to stop reading about him. By Order of the Phoenix, we had realised
          that Snape was a complicated chap who still had a problem with Harry, who doesn’t completely trust him. But
          by lying to Dolores Umbridge about the Truth Potion, he was helping to shield Harry and the whole Order
          from the attention of the Ministry of Magic, showing us his intentions really were noble, even if he was
          not always able to show them.<br><br>

          <strong>Albus Dumbledore:
          ‘It is time,’ he said, ‘for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down.
          I am going to tell you everything.’ </strong><br><br>
          In 1980, the Hogwarts Headmaster sat in the Hog’s Head and listened to Sybill Trelawney recount what
          would become known as the Lost Prophecy. It was, you might say, pretty important to the life of Harry
          Potter, given that it explained why the Darkest wizard of all time so badly wanted to kill him (turned
          out it wasn’t just because he was jealous of his Quidditch skills). However, Dumbledore decided not to
          pass it on to Harry – not when he started at Hogwarts, not after he had several encounters with Voldemort
          himself, not even when Harry asked him why Voldemort tried to murder him when he was a baby.<br><br>
          Dumbledore had his reasons, of course, and did what he thought best, but would a bit more information
          have helped Harry understand the situation in which he found himself? You could argue that withholding
          the truth is a form of lying: if so Dumbledore dropped one of the biggest whoppers of all time.
